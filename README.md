## 🛠️ Build & Run

> **Platform:** Windows only (uses `windows.h` and `conio.h`)

### ⚡ Option 1 — One-Click (Recommended)

Double-click **`build.bat`** — it compiles and launches the game automatically.

> Requires [MinGW-w64 g++](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) installed and in your `PATH`.

### 🔨 Option 2 — Manual g++ (MinGW)

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o CarGame.exe CarGame.cpp
CarGame.exe
```

### 📦 Option 3 — CMake

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
.\build\CarGame.exe
```

> Works with both **MinGW (`mingw32-make`)** and **MSVC (Visual Studio)**.

### 🖥️ Option 4 — Visual Studio

1. Create a new **Empty C++ Project**
2. Add `CarGame.cpp` to the project
3. Press **Ctrl+F5** to build and run

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Enemies** spawn at the top of the road and fall downward each frame.
2. **Your car** stays near the bottom — dodge left or right.
3. Every enemy that passes without a collision **adds +1 to your score**.
4. A **second enemy** activates mid-round; a **third enemy** activates at score 5.
5. Every 5 points the game **speeds up** (5 difficulty levels, max at score 20).
6. A collision triggers **Game Over** — your result is saved to `data.txt`.
7. View your full history any time from **Menu → Stats**.

### 📊 Difficulty Curve

| Score | Speed  | Level |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 0–4   | Slow   | 1     |
| 5–9   | Normal | 2     |
| 10–14 | Fast   | 3     |
| 15–19 | Faster | 4     |
| 20+   | Max    | 5     |

## 📋 Notes

- Frame speed is **adaptive** — ranges from 70ms (level 1) to 18ms (level 5).
- Enemy spawn uses a **conflict-check** to prevent unfair overlapping positions.
- Stats are **appended** to `data.txt` (never overwritten) — full history is kept.
- The codebase is a single **`CarGame` class** — no external dependencies.
